            Auto-generated monthly coverage threshold increase for TypeScript code.
            
            This PR increases the NYC coverage lines threshold by 5 percentage points,
            but only if current coverage already meets the new target.
            
            **Safety guarantee**: Existing tests will continue to pass.
            
            Changes:
            - Updated coverage threshold in .nycrc.json
            - Current coverage verified to support new threshold
            
            Monthly coverage improvement as part of quality enhancement initiative.
            Aligns with Python repositories' coverage gate automation.
